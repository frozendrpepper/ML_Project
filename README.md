# Kaggle Animal Shelter Outcome Project

This project attempts to solve Shelter Animal Outcomes competition posted on Kaggle. Basically, based on some information about shelter animal, we'd like to make the outcome prediction.

## Repository Deprecation

This repository was the actual repository used during the project and the team members contributed to each branch (ck, joseph, jwon). But this has been causing some headache as far as cleaning everything up and uploading presentable final version on the Master branch. So I created a new repository called [Animal_Shelter_project](https://github.com/frozendrpepper/Animal_Shelter_project). Please refer to that repository for the final version of the project.
